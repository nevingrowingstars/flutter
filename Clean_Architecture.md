#### Clean Architecture

A feature-based folder structure is an excellent choice for scalability and modularity in a Flutter application. Below is a suggested folder structure tailored to your requirements:

##### Core Module:

Centralized utilities, constants, and themes, ensuring consistency across the app. The responsive_layout.dart handles dynamic layouts for responsiveness, while adaptive_util.dart facilitates platform-specific adaptations.

##### Features Module:

Each feature (e.g., Classroom, LessonTool, Homework) is a self-contained module with clear separation between data, domain, and presentation layers to adhere to clean architecture principles.

##### Shared Module:

Houses reusable widgets, helpers, and extensions that are not feature-specific but are shared across the app. For example, the page_break_widget and session_recorder can be reused by multiple features.

##### Themes:

The core/themes/ folder contains light and dark themes with a ThemeProvider for runtime switching.

##### Responsiveness and Adaptiveness:

The core/utils/ folder includes utilities like responsive_layout.dart and device_helper.dart to ensure the UI adapts to various screen sizes and device orientations.

##### App Module:

Contains app-wide configurations, routing, and localization for managing navigation and supporting multiple languages.

This structure ensures the app is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain, while facilitating responsiveness, adaptability, and reusability across web and tablet platforms.
