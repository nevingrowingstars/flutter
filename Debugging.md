# Debugging


If your Flutter application is failing on the tablet and you need to view the error logs to debug the issue, you can access those logs using Android's logcat utility or Flutter's logging tools. Since the app is already deployed as an APK, you can still capture logs directly from the tablet or device using the following methods:

### 1. Using adb logcat to View Logs from the Tablet


adb logcat allows you to view logs from an Android device or emulator, including logs generated by your Flutter application. Here's how to do it:

## Step-by-Step:

### Enable USB Debugging on your Tablet:

Go to Settings > About tablet (or About device).
Tap Build number 7 times to enable Developer options.

Go to Developer options and turn on USB debugging.

### Connect Your Tablet to Your Computer via USB.

#### Open a Terminal/Command Prompt on your computer.

Verify the connection with the following command:

bash

      adb devices


If your tablet is connected correctly, you should see its device ID listed.

### Start adb logcat to capture logs:

Use this command to capture all logs from the device:

Copy code

      adb logcat

You will see a continuous stream of logs. To filter and view only the relevant logs for your Flutter app, you can use the following:

Copy code

      adb logcat -s flutter

This will show logs tagged with flutter, which typically include logs generated by print() and debugPrint() statements in your Flutter app.

###  Look for Errors:

Any exceptions or errors thrown by your app should appear in the log output.

Look for stack traces, which will give you detailed information about where the error occurred in the code.

Pay attention to log entries with tags such as E/Flutter, D/Flutter, or I/FlutterActivity, as these often contain important error and debugging information.

2. Using Flutter's flutter logs Command (Alternative to adb logcat)

You can also use Flutterâ€™s own logging command (flutter logs) to view logs if your tablet is connected via USB and your app is running.

### Connect your tablet to your computer with USB.

#### Open a Terminal/Command Prompt.

Run the following command to view the logs:

bash

      flutter logs

This will show the logs generated by your app, including any exceptions, print statements, and Flutter framework logs.

Look for Error Messages:

Errors, exceptions, and stack traces will be visible in the log output.

3. Viewing Logs in Real-Time on the Tablet (Using Android Device)

If you prefer to view the logs directly on the tablet (without using a computer), you can use an Android log viewer app, such as Logcat Extreme or aLogcat.

Steps to Use Logcat Extreme (or Similar Apps):

Download and Install an Android logcat viewer app from the Google Play Store:

Logcat Extreme

      aLogcat

Run the Logcat Viewer App.

#### Enable USB Debugging on your tablet if not already done.

Use the app to view logs on the tablet. You should be able to see logs from the system and your Flutter app, including errors or stack traces.

Filter by tags (e.g., flutter) to see only the Flutter logs.

You can also filter by severity (e.g., Error, Warning) to narrow down to important logs.
